# library

Project in accordance to The Odin Project's Javascript course.

Objective of this project is to create a library with the help of constructors that generates new book object every time a user adds a book.

Book object will then be added into an array where informations regarding books in the library are stored. 

## General Overview 

Out of personal interest, a cover page prior to entering the online library is created to attempt switching html scripts as seen below.

Once the user clicks on enter, the user will be brought to the user interface of the library.

The user interface was built with the idea of a warm welcome in mind, while making it easy to understand how this library is supposed to be used. 

Elements of this website includes: 
1. "Add Book" button that shows a form where user may enter a new book's information. (Checks for duplicates and applicable information is implemented)
2. "X", a delete button under the action column will remove any book entries. 
3. "READ/NOT READ", a status button that changes upon clicking it to reflect user's progress for the book. 
4. "HOME" button, that basically refreshes the page back to the original form of the HTML + JS code. 
5. "SUMMARY" button, supposedly shows the information regarding the library (e.g. # of books, overall status, etc.) TO BE ADDED. 

If the user would like to add a book, they may click on "+Add Book" button and begin filling out the form before clicking on submit. Existence of duplicates or restricted characters in the input field will result in an alert notifying the user of their mistake.
